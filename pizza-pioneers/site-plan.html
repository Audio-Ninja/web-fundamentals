      People should come to The Pizza Pioneers website when they seek delicious pizza whenever they need it. Since we have pizzas ready on the go, we should be able to help those who are in a rush. So if you are short on time, we should have some pizzas ready to-go, and you can order among those. People will come to the site mainly for ordering food for pickup, but the site can also serve those looking for information about us or to give feedback. Weâ€™d like to hear from you, whether that includes ways we can improve and areas where we did well. The information we offer includes our menu, list of toppings and food allergy accommodations, and store phone numbers and locations. At The Pizza Pioneers, we use fresh, organic food that tastes awesome, and is good for you too! That, combined with fast, high-quality service, makes us an ideal choice. You can view more about the nutritional information of our toppings, pizzas, and others on our website. You can also expect to find answers to frequently asked questions.

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        Is there any information I need to enter to order online?
      If you are making an order online, the only information you may need to enter would be what you want for your order. You can enter your credit card information to pay, though you can also just select the option that you want to pay when you get to the store. If you choose to create an account, you'll need to enter your name, email, zip code, and phone number. The zip code is used for deals and news based on the nearest store to you. And as an option, you will also be able to enter your birthday to receive an annual birthday coupon! 
        What about dietary restrictions?
We offer gluten-free crust and dairy-free cheese as alternatives for those with such dietary restrictions. We also offer sauces other than the traditional marinara sauce, such as ranch, if you need to stay away from tomatoes. For any other dietary restrictions or preferences, you can view the toppings on each of our pizzas and adjust them for your needs. You can also just build your own pizza with whatever crust, sauce, and toppings you would like.
Are there advantages to ordering through the website?
Certainly! You can order in the store or take a call when that's convenient, but there are advantages to ordering through our website. First of all, there are exclusive limited-time deals available on the website, with new ones every few weeks. You can also create a free account on the website to build up reward points across orders. You can then use these points in future orders for free food!
What are the advantages of creating an account?
The first advantage of creating an account is to be able to gain and keep track of points with each item you order. With enough of these points gathered over time, you can redeem them for free menu items depending on your number of points. You can also receive a coupon for a certain free item on your birthday. If you so choose, you can receive updates by either email or text about upcoming deals. And finally, by having an account, you can save your favorites and repeat previous orders for faster checkout.
