            <button class="collapsible">What information do I need to enter to order online?</button>
            <div class="faqs-content">
                <p>If you are making an order online, the only information you may need to enter would be what you want for your 
                order. You can enter your credit card information to pay, though you can also just select the option that you 
                want to pay when you get to the store. You only need to enter your specific address if you're ordering for delivery. 
                If you choose to create an account, you’ll need to enter your name, email,
                zip code, and phone number. The zip code is used for deals and news based on the nearest store to you. And as an
                option, you will also be able to enter your birthday to receive an annual birthday coupon!</p>

            <button class="collapsible">What about dietary restrictions?</button>
            <div class="faqs-content">
                <p>We offer gluten-free crust and dairy-free cheese as alternatives for those with such dietary restrictions. We 
                also offer sauces other than the traditional marinara sauce, such as ranch, if you need to stay away from 
                tomatoes. For any other dietary restrictions or preferences, you can view the toppings on each of our pizzas 
                and adjust them for your needs. You can also just build your own pizza with whatever crust, sauce, and toppings you would like.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">Are there advantages to ordering through the website?</button>
            <div class="faqs-content">
                <p>Certainly! You can order in the store or take a call when that’s convenient, but there are advantages to ordering through our 
                website. First of all, there are exclusive limited-time deals available on the website, with new ones every few weeks. You can also 
                create a free account on the website to build up reward points across orders. You can then use these points in future orders for free food!</p>

            <button class="collapsible">What are the advantages of creating an account?</button>
            <div class="faqs-content">
                <p>The first advantage of creating an account is to be able to gain and keep track of points with each item you order. With enough of these 
                points gathered over time, you can redeem them for free menu items depending on your number of points. You can also receive a coupon for a 
                certain free item on your birthday. If you so choose, you can receive updates by either email or text about upcoming deals. And finally, 
                by having an account, you can save your favorites and repeat previous orders for faster checkout.</p>
