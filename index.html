    <p>Here are a few things about me:</p>
    <p>I am taking Web Fundamentals as part of my Computer Science degree.</p>
    <p>My primary hobbies are reading and game development. I plan on pursuing game development or some other programming career within Computer Science as my full-time job.</p>
    <p>
        I've taken two semesters of a web design class in highschool, where I learned to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to create websites. It was pretty fun!
        That said, I already have experience in web design, but I have already learned a little bit so far, and I will push myself to learn as much as I can!
    </p>

        I have been a part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for all the 18 years of my life. I recently submitted my papers so I can go out and serve 
        a mission for two years after this semester. After that, I will return to college here at BYU-I and stay until I earn my Bachelor's.
